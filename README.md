<span style="font-size:1.5em;">*Your team’s mission today is to learn more about AI capabilities through hands on practice by completing challenges in two key areas: Cognitive Services and Bots.*</span>

<span style="font-size:1.25em;">Your team will start by building a simple C# application that allows you to ingest pictures from your local drive, then invoke the [Computer Vision API][Computer Vision API] to analyze the images and obtain tags and a description. Once you have this data, you will process it to pull out the details we need, and store it all into [Cosmos DB][Cosmos DB].</span>

<span style="font-size:1.25em;">You'll continue by build an [Azure Search Index][Azure Search] (Azure Search is our PaaS offering for faceted, fault tolerant search) on top of Cosmos DB, then you’ll build a [Bot Framework][Bot Framework] bot to query it. Finally, you'll extend this bot with [Language Understanding (LUIS)][LUIS] to automatically derive intent from your queries and use those to direct your searches intelligently.</span>
